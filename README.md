# ♾️ OpenStack MicroCeph Lab (Applied Lab Project)

This lab project explores how to set up and operate an **Ubuntu-based OpenStack environment** with **Ceph as the storage backend**. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with OpenStack services, Ceph storage integration, and day-2 operations. It covers deploying **MicroStack** and **MicroCeph**, connecting **Cinder** and **Glance** to Ceph, running storage benchmarks, and practicing failure recovery scenarios. The lab is designed for **learning, repeatability, and documentation** rather than production use.

## 🎯 Learning Milestones  
- **M1**: Launch a single-node MicroStack instance; deploy first VM and test floating IP  
- **M2**: Add a compute node (`cmp-01`) and practice VM live migration  
- **M3**: Deploy a 3-node MicroCeph cluster; integrate Cinder (RBD) and Glance with Ceph storage  
- **M4**: Benchmark storage performance with `fio` (RBD) and record results  
- **M5**: Run failure drills (e.g. stop an OSD, reboot a node) and observe VM/data continuity  
- **M6**: Explore hardening & operations — RBAC, quotas, backups, and scripted day-2 tasks

## 🚀 Quick Start  
1. Prepare an Ubuntu 22.04 host or VMs.  
2. Follow setup steps in [`docs/02-setup-ubuntu.md`](docs/02-setup-ubuntu.md).  
3. Deploy MicroStack and MicroCeph, then work through the milestone exercises.

## 📌 Notes  
- This project is intended for **learning and experimentation**.  
- It focuses on understanding **how OpenStack and Ceph interact** and practicing operational tasks in a safe lab setup.
